# tic_tac_toe

## Project Description   

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game playable between customizable player types: human and/or bot, made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) open source web development course. It is the [2nd project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) of the intermediate JavaScript section. Bot AI will be implemented later as part of a future milestone.

## Skills

This project is mainly to show learned skills in JavaScript program design and code organization. It makes primary use of the JavaScript module design pattern (IIFEs) as well as factory functions with inheritance for creation and composition of objects. This aims to allow for data encapsulation, high maintainability of code, and separation of concerns. 

By encapsulating data, whenever an object needs to access the data or services provided by another, it is done via the interface provided by another object in the form of exposed methods to access **closure variables**. This allows variables to selectively be kept private or public but with restricted, well controlled access. 

Each object bundles data and related functionality to form a dedicated role and may use the services of other objects with dedicated roles within their composition.
